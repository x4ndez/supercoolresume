## Introduction

I designed and coded this page as part of my week 2 challenge for my edX/Monash bootcamp.  The week 2 challenge is a "build-from-scratch" challenge meaning there are no supplied code or assets to the project.  I made a wireframe of the site I made... but in the midst of coding it, I was unhappy with it, so I ended up designing while I coded.  I think this is quite a time-consuming process, I think if I was to do it again, I would design something I was a lot more content with before I started coding.  In saying that... this was my first build-from-scratch project, so there's many more to come!

What did I learn doing this exercise? I became a lot better at structuring a page, better learned about inheritance, pseudos and using combinators. I finally figured out there's a property called box-sizing that allowed me to include the padding in the total dimensions of a box, which saved me a lot of time. For the sake of the exercise, I told myself... NO JAVASCRIPT. There was some cool effects I was going to include, I tried finding ways around it without JS, but ultimately decided to just build things different with CSS, it worked out well, and I ended up learning more!

## Developer Comments

With the time I had I wasn't able to design a complete website I was 100% happy with, so some things won't look very polished, and there are bugs.
